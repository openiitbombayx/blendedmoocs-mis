Information System for IITBombayX Blended MOOCs

A few years ago, the online learning world was abuzz with a new revolutionary concept – MOOC i.e. Massive Online Open Courses. But, soon this new approach started to fizzle out, as it had its own share of inherent issues which have been well documented. The need to find a solution led to the adoption of a new approach of Blended MOOCs, wherein the students would learn “online” but would also be guided by their own teachers inside the classroom.
Working on the same principle, IITBombayX (https://iitbombayx.in) is the online eXtension educational service of IIT Bombay. It offers a Blended model to Indian students, which combines the benefits of a high quality MOOC, and the advantage of face-to-face learning, and mentoring by their own teachers.
There are around 60 institutes participating in the program.It adds an additional task for the  teacher is to be a facilitator to collect weekly updates on assignments completed on MOOCs course from students.After collecting the data, they have to collate the data and include in the grading system. To reduce the role of teacher as Facilitator, A teacher's dashboard was introduced. This system is called as Information System for IITBombayX Blended MOOCs.
